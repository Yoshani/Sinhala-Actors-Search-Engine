In 1971, he made a short film called ""Hada Aedi Siththam"". There he met Giwantha Arthasad and Bermin Lyle Fernando.He began his career as a stage performer in a passion play staged at Moratumulla Church directed by Rev. Theodore H Perera. He further developed his drama skills at the Wesley Gulld and the Bible School of the Willorawatte Church. He has produced Christian Dramas for the NCC Radio. His maiden cinema acting came through Jeewanthi directed by Hemasiri Sellapperuma. His career completely changed when he met Giwantha Arthasad's younger brother, Dinesh Priyasad. The two did a little experiment together where they made a short film called ""Action"".Cooray debuted in Sinhala cinema as a screenwriter in Dinesh Priyasad's directorial debut Nommara Ekai. He wrote the story and screenplay, as well as acting in the film.  Producing the low budget Nommara Ekai, it became a big hit. Later Dinesh joined a new project of Thilak Athapaththu, after the success of Nommara Ekai. Dinesh thought that Cooray knew what the people liked or disliked, and he turned to Cooray to write a new film script. He started to write a script, thinking like a main actor in film. He asked for a chance to play the main character. Athapaththu refused, because Cooray was a newcomer in the industry. and he wasn't ready to take a risk. Anyhow, he got a chance to perform minor role in film. Then Tennyson wrote the plot of blockbuster hit Peralikarayo which was not only the most popular film of 1986, but also the highest grossing film of that year.During Peralikarayo, Tennyson and Priyasad met Vijaya Kumaratunga. Later, they involved in Kumaratunga's first film production  Waradata Danduwama. Later he got a chance to be the script writer for Priyasad's blockbuster hit Demodara Palama, where he played the role 'Vali Cooray' opposite to Gamini Fonseka. Priyasad's film Hithata Dukak Nathi Miniha was a film that pulls aside the acting style of Tenny where his ability for those adventurous scenes is highlighted in the film. He performed well not only in cinema but also on stage with the popular stage plays Man The Man, Captain Cool, Sivamma Dhanapala and I am Sri Lanka. In each of these stage plays, he discusses the issues and problems of the society in a humorous manner, tries to make the audience laugh as well as try to draw the audience's attention to the issues of the country.He produced Akikaru Puthraya, the first Christian 16 mm Sinhala film and then he produced three stage dramas; Kurulla, Man The Man and I am Sri Lanka. He has also appeared in comedy films with fellow actor Bandu Samarasinghe on numerous occasions, including Re Daniel Dawal Migel, Cheriyo, Kolompoor, Parliament Jokes, and Somy Boys. All the films were blockbuster hits where as Bandu-Tenny duo made a comedy cinema wave during 1990s and early new millennium.
Around 2010, the Sarasaviya newspaper published a series of weekly Q&A articles with Tennyson under the title 'Tennysongen Ahanna'. It was a popular feature in the newspaper at the time. His answers to the questions posed by readers are hilarious. He has acted only a handful of television serials as he personally disliked acting in teledramas and preferred to be involved in major productions such as films.Cooray wrote the story for Priyasad's Kolompoor and acted with Bandu, which became a blockbuster in that year. In 2001, Tennyson made his maiden cinema direction with the comedy film Thank You Berty. He also acted in the film along with longtime friend Bandu Samarasinghe. Apart from that, he also directed the home movie Eya Thamai Meya in 2015. In 2011, he went to the United Kingdom for a series of concerts organized by UK charity '1+1=1'.In 2018, Tennyson acted in the film Yama Raja Siri with Bandu for the first time in 10 years. In the same year, he acted in the comedy theater play Reliy Remix produced by Sisil Gunasekara.

She made it to the silver screen via the stage and had acted in close to 100 films, at the time of her death. Having an equal passion for singing as well as a melodious voice, she was Sri Lanka's foremost female singer in the gramophone era. After her death, she was awarded the Sarasaviya 'Rana Thisara'- Life Time Achievement Award at the 1979 Sarasaviya Awards Festival.","Rukmani Devi, was born as Daisy Rasammah Daniels to a Tamil Colombo Chetty Christian family on 15 January 1923 at Ramboda in Nuwara Eliya, Sri Lanka. Second, in a family of five, her father, John Daniel worked on a plantation and her mother, Helen Rose was a teacher. She grew up in Colombo and had her early education at St. Matthew's School and then moved on to St. Clare's School, Wellawatte. 
She was married to veteran dramatist, actor and singer, Eddie Jayamanne, whom she fell in love with as a result of her close association with him, when performing in dramas produced by ""Minerva Dramatic Club"" founded by B. A. W. Jayamanne. They lived at ""Jaya Ruk"", at Angurukaramulla, Negombo.",,,"As a little girl, Daniels showed an inborn talent to sing and dance. At the age of seven, she was picked to sing Christmas carols. Impressed with her ability to sing, dance, and also to act, she was selected to perform a main role in a Christmas play, 'The Shoemaker's Wife'. The stage play was trained and presented by St. Clare's School, Wellawatte. Watching her play this role much enthusiastically, Walter Abeysinghe, a drama producer sought permission from her father, to invite her to play the lead role of 'Sita' in his drama 'Ramayanaya.' Thus, in 1935 at the age of just 12 years she performed in this stage play, presented by the 'Sinhala Natya Sabha'.
This marked the beginning of an illustrious career that would span over four decades. As her performances were highly appreciated by the packed audience, well-known dramatist Dick Dias chose her for two of his stage plays, ""Jana Kiharanaya"" and ""Mayawathie"". She was now flooded with stage dramas, as she became Mayawathi in Charles Dias' 'Mayawathi', Juliet in a Sinhala adaption of Romeo and Juliet, playing the lead female role in all of them. Rukmani performed her singing career as a simple singer on Sri Lankan radio in the mid-1940s.
Gabriel Gunaratne, who was in charge of recording songs at the then His Master's Voice (HMV) Gramophone Records Company, was the permanent music director of the company. She was introduced to the H. W. Rupasinghe one day in October 1938 by Gunaratne. Rupasinghe, who saw Rukmani's singing prowess, chose her for the first album, which was launched by Master His Voice No. 9300. With her first audio recording of the famous song ""Siri Buddhagaya Vihare"" with Master ""H. W. Rupasinghe"". in 1938 at the age of 15, she captured the hearts of the masses and she shaped her career from that of an actress to that of an actress turned singer. This song was recorded to 78 rpm (gramophone) record label HMV with the number N-9300 and issued in 1939 by the Cargills Ltd, local agents for HMV. 
Her unique voice attracted many music directors, as her singing career moved from the stage to the silver screen. Joining Rupasinghe Master's band as a regular singer, she faced three challenges at the time. That is, she had not studied Hindustani classical music properly as well as had to compete with renowned singers of that year such as Lakshmi Bai, Annie Boteju and Susila Jayasinghe. The third was the language challenge. She did not know how to read or write Sinhala and she used to write it all down in English. Due to the vocal training given by Rupasinghe Master through those songs, she soon became a simple classical singer as well as the most popular young singer on the His Masters Voice record company. During 1938-45, she recorded 44 songs for HMV Records. Rukmani sang almost all the Sinhala songs composed in Hindi and Vanga classical songs sung by Kumari Jutika Roy, then popularly known as ""Bhajan Songstress"" in India.It was also, around this time that her name underwent a change from Daisy Daniels to the well known 'Rukmani Devi'. There are two schools of thinking as to how the name ""Rukmani Devi"" originated. According to one school, the late H. W. Rupasinghe maestro created the name, while the other believe that Jayantha Weerasekara and Michael Sannas Liyanage who is in his 90s, created it. Entering the stage, Rukmani had the opportunity to perform in Noorthi dramas such as Janakiharanaya, Rohini and Mayawathi. Since 1940, B. A. W. Jayamanne, founder of ""Minerva Dramatic Club"" of Negombo took Rukmani to perform remarkable roles in his dramas, such as 'Apparition', 'Broken Promise', 'Changing Fate, 'Defeated Aim', 'Evasive Denial', 'Fanatic Faith', 'Grisly Guardian', 'Hasty Decision' and lastly 'Irangani'. Above-mentioned plays followed the English alphabet.
The popular play 'Broken Promise' (Kadawunu Poronduwa), was adapted into a film by B. A. W. Jayamanne. This was the first Sinhala film – Kadawunu Poronduwa, screened on 21 January 1947. Rukmani Devi, who also began her film career through the role of 'Ranjani' in this film, also became the first local cinema actress. Her film career, which thus began spread over a period of more than three decades. According to Sri Lankeya Cinema Vanshaya (pp 637 – 638) written by Nuwan Nayanajith Kumara, from Kadawunu Poronduwa in 1947 to Ara Soyza in 1984, Rukmani Devi had played different roles in 99 films, up to the time of her death. Rukmani Devi won the first place in the ""Popular Singing Series"" in the 1953 Radio Artists Classification Test.An equally talented singer, some of the immortal songs she sang for films are Sandyave Sriya for 'Kadawunu Poronduwa', Pinsara Mage Soyura for 'Kapati Arakshakaya', Gala Kandeni, and Moranawa Preme Hade for 'Weradun Kurumanama', Nindede Rathri Yahane for 'Peralena Iranama', Mavila Pena vi Rupe for 'Kela Handa', Pem Sihina Loke Maya for 'Mathabhedaya', Melavi Yanna Hada Mage for 'Daiva Yogaya', Suva dena Sita Sanasum for 'Ladalu' and Doi Doi Puta for 'Ahasin Polavata'. In 1975 Rukmani sing ""Pem Rajatahane"" with Milton Mallawarachchi. Rukmani made duets with amateur singers since the 1960s, such as: song ""Ada Handapana Paya Hari Lassanai"" with Sujatha Perera (Attanayake), ""Gang Ivuru Paduru Gane"" with Sidney Attygalle, ""Kokilaya Keviliya"", ""Denna Piriye Dethata Oya Detha"" with H. R. Jothipala, and ""Ithin Palak Nehe Kumariya"" with J. A. Milton Perera.In the mid sixties she joined the Sinhala calypso musical group 'Los Cabelleros' led by late Neville Fernando. They recorded ever popular sinhala songs such as ""Malbara Himidiriye"", ""Menike Obe Sinawe"" & ""Sandak Nage"".
